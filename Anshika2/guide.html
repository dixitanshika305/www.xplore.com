                Picture this – you’re about to set off on an exciting holiday. You’ve got your travel visa, your tickets, hotel bookings and everything else in order. You land at your destination and find that your luggage has been misplaced. Or worse, you’re the victim of theft and you are left in a foreign country without your passport or any cash! Dealing with these situations can be expensive and difficult – especially if you’re in a country where you don’t speak the language. But that’s precisely why travel insurance is so crucial!<br>
<br>
<br>
Travel insurance is the assurance that your journey will be protected and insured from possible risks that may come unexpectedly on unknown lands. Travel insurance is a unique product that offers you financial help in case something were to go wrong while you’re travelling. It covers a range of scenarios, including medical and dental emergencies, theft of your money or passport loss, flight cancellation and misplaced or lost luggage.

Depending on where you’re going, the purpose of your visit and how often you travel, you can select a travel insurance policy that best suits your needs. A single-trip travel insurance plan is ideal if you’re travelling domestically or internationally and only travel once in a while, a single trip travel insurance can be purchased for yourself or for your family, for more information, check our family travel insurance. If you travel often for work, you may want to opt for a multi-trip travel insurance plan or an annual travel insurance plan. This way, you can save on the hassle of applying for a new travel insurance policy before each trip. We also offer customised travel insurance plans for senior citizens and students who are heading abroad to continue their education. No matter what your travel needs, we’ll find a travel insurance policy for you
